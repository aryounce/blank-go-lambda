# Blank Go Lambda Template

This is a starter template for AWS Lambda functions written in Golang.

## Setup

Two steps are recommended to get started:

1. Export (do not clone) this project, or use it as a repo template, into a new
   git repository.
2. Run `make mod-reinit` to rename the Go module for your project (in `go.mod`).

# TODO

- Demonstrated references to the shared module.
